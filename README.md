# CANCER-PREDICTION-USING-GENE-EXPRESSION
In this project, we explored cancer classification using 14,500+ gene features. After careful preprocessing and feature selection, we applied Random Forest and Logistic Regression (OvR). The approach performed well, with F1-scores of 1.00 (public) and 0.991 (private) in the hackathon (link in ABOUT THE PROJECT.pdf).
